        <h2 class="info-heading">About Linux</h2>
        <p class="info-paragraph">Linux is a widely-used open-source operating system, similar to Windows, Mac, and Android. It shares similarities with Unix, another operating system known for its commercial use. Unix and Linux have comparable components, including the kernel, shell, and programs. Many commands in Unix and Linux exhibit similar behavior and syntax.</p>

        <h2 class="info-heading">What is Linux Operating System</h2>
        <p class="info-paragraph">The Linux Operating System is a type of operating system that is similar to Unix, and it is built upon the Linux Kernel. The Linux Kernel is like the brain of the operating system because it manages how the computer interacts with its hardware and resources. It makes sure everything works smoothly and efficiently. But the Linux Kernel alone is not enough to make a complete operating system.
                <br>
            To create a full and functional system, the Linux Kernel is combined with a collection of software packages and utilities, which are together called Linux distributions.
                <br>
            These distributions make the Linux Operating System ready for users to run their applications and perform tasks on their computers securely and effectively. Linux distributions come in different flavors, each tailored to suit the specific needs and preferences of users.</p>

        <h2 class="info-heading">About Linux Commands</h2>
        <p class="info-paragraph">Linux commands are instructions given to the system to perform specific tasks. Each command in Linux is a tool designed for a particular purpose, such as managing files, controlling processes, or modifying system settings. Commands are typically entered in the terminal, which is a command-line interface for interacting with the operating system.
              <br>
         Linux commands offer flexibility and power, allowing users to automate tasks and efficiently manage system resources. The system is case-sensitive, so the command <code> ls </code> is different from <code> LS </code>. Additionally, Linux commands often come with manuals (<code> man </code> pages) to provide detailed usage instructions.</p>
